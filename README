NAME
    WWW::MSA::Hadith

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::MSA::Hadith;

      my $h = new WWW::MSA::Hadith();
      $h->query('(paradise or heaven) and laugh and man and last');
      $h->submit();

      while ( my $result = $h->get_result() ) {
        print $h->read( $result->{id} );
        print "-" x 32;
        print "\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    WWW::MSA::Hadith is Perl interface to MSA-USC's Classic Hadith Search
    engine located at
    http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/reference/searchhadith.html

    As of this release, only Sahih Bukhari database is supported. Will try
    to add other databases in subsequent releases.

PROGRAMMING STYLE
    Searching Hadith database is very straight-forward, and consists of the
    following steps:

    1   Create WWW::MSA::Hadith object:

          my $h = new WWW::MSA::Hadith();

    2   Define the search query:

          $h->query("warn and peace");

    3   Submit the search to remote server:

          $h->submit();

    4   Iterate through the results:

          while (my $result = $h->get_result() ) {
            # do something....
          }

    get_result() method, as seen above, results the next result fetched from
    the database. To iterate over all the results, you should use it in a
    while() loop or alternative.

    Return value of get_result() is a reference to a hash-table. Hash
    consists of such keys as *id* - unique id for the returned Hadith, *url*
    - address of the resource, *volume* - volume number of the hadith,
    *book* - book number of the hadith and *report* - report number of the
    hadith.

    As you noticed, returned result does not include the full content. To
    fetch the full content for a specific hadith, you need to call read()
    method and pass it *id* field of the result:

      $full_text = $h->read($result->{id});

    To view the demo of this library, send an e-mail to hadith@handalak.com
    and submit the search keyword in the subject of the mail. You will
    receive the results in the reply.

TODO
    I've been thinking of creating better programming interface through
    XML-RPC API.
